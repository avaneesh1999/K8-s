# Docker Common Problems

Here are some common problems that can arise when using Docker:

1. **Single Host:** When running Docker on a single host, you may encounter limitations in terms of scalability and redundancy.

2. **Auto Healing:** Docker containers don't automatically recover from failures. You need to implement a mechanism for auto-healing your containers.

3. **Auto Scaling:** Docker alone doesn't provide native auto-scaling features. You may need to use additional tools or platforms to handle auto-scaling.

4. **Enterprise Support:** In enterprise environments, you may require dedicated support and service-level agreements (SLAs) that Docker might not provide.
